# Sensor Class
The goal of this project is to create a sensor library in OOP. The process started with UML diagram and list of features to implement. System is based on Raspberry Pi which communicates with sensor, processes data and acts as a MQTT broker. This approach makes it simpler to connect any sensor and use it in IoT application with minimal changes in the code. Measurements are available through MQTT protocol on Grafana, MQTT Dash or any other MQTT client.
